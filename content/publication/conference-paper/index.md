  We prove two sets of results concerning computational conmplexity classes. 

  The first concerns a variation of the random oracle hypothesis 

  posed by Bennett and Gill after they showed that relative to a randomly chosen 

  oracle, P is not equal to NP with probability 1. 

  This hypothesis was quickly disproven in several ways, most famously in 1992

  with the result that IP equals PSPACE, in spite of the

  classes being shown unequal with probability 1. Here we propose 

  a variation of what it means to be ``large'' using the Ellentuck topology.

  In this new context, we demonstrate that the set of oracles separating

  NP and coNP is not small, and obtain similar

  results for the separation of PSPACE from PH

  along with the separation of NP from BQP.

  We demonstrate that this version of the hypothesis turns it into a

  sufficient condition for unrelativized relationships, at least

  in the three cases considered here. Second, we example the descriptive 

  complexity of the classes of oracles providing the separations for 

  these various classes, and determine their exact placement in the 

  Borel hierarchy.
