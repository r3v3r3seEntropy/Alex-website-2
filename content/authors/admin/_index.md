I﻿'m an antidisciplinary mathematician seeking to popularize knowledge and do what I can to bring about a better future. I belief this involves not only designing systems, but also finding strategies that can be acted out by regular people to bring about that future. While I do consider myself a capable researcher of any topic, I pride myself on my ability to take difficult material and find new
ways to popularly present it, making it accessible to everyone rather than just the elites of academia. 

By calling myself antidisciplinary I am declaring my intention to reject the confining of myself to any particular niche specialization. I am a mathematician, and I think like one. However, I intend to bring that viewpoint wherever my interests take me, whether that be economics, sociology, cybernetics, philosophy or history, in order to both pursue a holistic view of the world and to provide a unique analytical perspective that perhaps couldn't be found elsewhere.
